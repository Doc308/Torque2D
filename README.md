Torque2D
========

MIT Licensed Open Source version of Torque 2D from GarageGames
Added Render option for Brash Monkey's Spriter
*** NOTE ***
User must create the .taml files for the images manually at this time.


Added NetworkToy - A very simplistic Network based on Legacy settings.
I reccommend setting the NetworkToy as default in preferences, as the Gui overlaps the tools currently.

//How to use this example

//1. Launch two versions of T2D

//2. Click StartServer button. You should see a connected message (the server computer connects as a client to itself).

//3. In the console on your client click JoinServer button. Click QueryLan, then Join Server. You should see a connected message.

//4. In the console on the server run 'serversayhi("NAME")'. Where NAME is your name or whatever.

//5. Check the console on the client and you should see "NAME (server) says hi!"

//6. In the console on the client run 'clientsayhi("NAME")'. Where NAME is your name or whatever. 

//7. Check the console on the client and you should see "NAME (client) says hi!"
